abstract = "Exotic Higgs decays are promising channels to discover new physics in the near future. We present a simple model with a new light scalar that couples to the Standard Model through a charged lepton-flavor violating interaction. This can yield exciting new signatures, such as $h \\to e^+e^+ \\mu^- \\mu^-$, that currently have no dedicated searches at the Large Hadron Collider. We discuss this model in detail, assess sensitivity from flavor constraints, explore current constraints from existing multi-lepton searches, and construct a new search strategy to optimally target these exotic, lepton-flavor violating Higgs decays."
