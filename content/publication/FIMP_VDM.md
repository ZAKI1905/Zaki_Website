abstract = "In this analysis we demonstrate the freeze-in realization of a non-abelian vector boson dark matter (DM). We choose to elaborate an existing SU(2)$_N$ extension (N stands for neutral) of the Standard Model (SM) with an additional $U(1)=S'$ global symmetry, which stabilizes the vector boson ($X,\\bar{X}$) as DM through unbroken $S=T_{3N}+S'$ as the lightest odd $S$ particle. Apart from showing the right order of the SU(2)$_N$ coupling ($\\sim 10^{-12}–10^{−13}$) required for the correct relic of DM via freeze in, the analysis reveals that the contribution to the freeze-in production of DM from the decay of a heavier scalar bi-doublet $\\zeta_1^{0,\\pm} \to \\zeta_2^{0,\\pm} X$ is equally important even after the decoupling of \\zeta_1^{0,\\pm} from the thermal bath. This treatment of computing the relic abundance in context with freeze-in is practically model-independent and can be applied to all the scenarios where the DM is produced from the decay of a massive particle which was once in equilibrium with the thermal bath. This bi-doublet earlier was in equilibrium with the visible sector due to SM SU(2)$_L$ coupling. Moreover, the neutral component of SU(2)$_N$ scalar triplet ($\\Delta$), responsible for neutrino mass generation in this framework, turns out to serve as additional DMs in the model and offers a multipartite freeze-in DM set up to explore. The allowed parameter space is obtained after estimating constraints from CMB, BBN and AMS-02 bound. This exercise nicely complements the freeze-out realization of ($X,\\bar{X}$) as weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and distinguishes it through stable charge track signature at collider compared to leptonic signal excess as in WIMP scenario."
